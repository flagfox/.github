# Howdy folks! We are Flagfox ðŸ¦Š

You might have found your way here because of Peter's popular [feature flagging Laravel package](https://github.com/ylsideas/feature-flags), or perhaps you follow Caroline's [sporatic and sometimes clever tweets](https://www.carolinepixels.com), or maybe you've read some of our open build articles. Whichever way you've found us, we are happy you are here. DON'T LEAVE! Oh, sorry, that was a bit full-on. I'm just keen.


## What the _fox_ is this all about?

Ok, straight to the point. I like your style. 

We are an engineer and a designer who work together daily and have a collaborative rhythm that would even make Jedward jealous.

We've gone through all the little awkward and painful moments that can crop up naturally in a product development cycle. You know, the ones:
- Charlie, the engineer, has smashed it. All their code is complete, perfect and ready for merging.
- But Charlie has to wait until when Lee, the marketer, is ready to release the feature to users.
- While waiting, other PRs cause merge conflicts, triggering new code reviews and testing, which just busts Charlie's bubble.
- But Lee is now ready to go and has to wait on Charlie to finish up,  so Lee delays the launch and creates a new plan.
- Now Charlie is ready, but Lee's timing plan doesn't match, so we are back with Charlie waiting and accumulating merge knock-ons.
Booooo.. hisssssss.... This sucks!

## Well what the _fox_ are you going to do about it?!! 

We are fully embracing the power of feature flagging as a potential red pill to help solve the headache of multi-feature-branch development. We are building off the learnings gained from Peter's open-source feature flag package and wrapping it in a powerful dashboard which you can install into your projects.

## Fantastic!! So how the _fox_ do I learn more?
